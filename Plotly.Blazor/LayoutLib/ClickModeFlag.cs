    ///     event data attached (kept for compatibility reasons). The *select* flag
    ///     enables selecting single data points via click. This mode also supports
    ///     persistent selections, meaning that pressing Shift while clicking, adds

    ///     can be confusing, consider explicitly setting `hovermode`: *closest* when
    ///     using this feature. Selection events are sent accordingly as long as *event*
    ///     flag is set as well. When the *event* flag is missing, `plotly_click` and
    ///     `plotly_selected` events are not fired.
