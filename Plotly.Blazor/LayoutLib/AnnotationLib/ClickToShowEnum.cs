    ///     else in the plot (on another data point or not) will hide this annotation.
    ///     If you need to show/hide this annotation in response to different `x` or
    ///     `y` values, you can set `xclick` and/or `yclick`. This is useful for example
    ///     to label the side of a bar. To label markers though, `standoff` is preferred
    ///     over `xclick` and `yclick`.
